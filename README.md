## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket on the bases of place of destination.

## Motivation
1.Real-World Impact: Helps travelers find cheaper flights, solving a common problem.

2.Complex Data: Involves handling diverse features like dates, seasons, demand, and routes.

3.Predictive Modeling: Challenges your machine learning skills by using time-series forecasting, regression models, or deep learning.

4.Dynamic Pricing: Deals with constantly changing airline prices, making prediction harder and more exciting.

5.Feature Engineering: Requires creativity to extract useful features from data like holidays, weather, and booking times.

6.Big Data Handling: Provides hands-on experience with large datasets from various airlines and travel platforms.

7.MLOps Practice: Involves deploying models that adapt to new data in real-time, aligning with your MLOps interests.

8.User-Focused: Offers a service that benefits a broad audience of frequent travelers.

9.Competitive Edge: Demonstrates your expertise in predictive analytics and pricing strategies.

10.Scalability: Can be extended to other domains like hotel prices or car rentals.
